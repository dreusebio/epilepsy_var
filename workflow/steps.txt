Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
. Pull down RNASeq reads from NCBI (sra-toolkit) 
. Quality check (fastQC & MultiQC)
. Trimming and cleaning of fastq files (Trimmomatic)
. Alignment to human reference genome - hg38 (STAR)
. Convert SAM files to BAM files (samtools)
. Sort BAM files (samtools)
. Variants calling (GATKs)
. Variant annotation (ANNOVAR)
. Count reads associated with each gene (FeatureCount)
. Differential gene expression analysis (DSEseq2)
. Enrichment analysis (GO-seq)
