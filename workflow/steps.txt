Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
. Pull down the reads from SRA Explorer
. Perform sequence quality control with FASTQC and MULTIQC
. Trimming of adapters and low quality reads from paired-end reads with Trimgalore
. Coversion of file from fastq to fasta format
. Preparation of the reference genome (i.e hg38) with Bismark and Bowtie2 pre alignment process
. Alignment of all dataset in the fasta format to the reference genome with Bismark
