Steps: [Convert the steps into workflow diagram (include tools for each step) and update README.md]
. Pull down the reads from SRA Explorer
. Perform sequence quality control with FASTQC and MULTIQC
. Trimming of adapters and low quality reads from paired-end reads with Trimgalore
. Preparation of the reference genome (i.e hg38) with Bismark and Bowtie2 pre alignment process
. Alignment of all dataset in the fastq format to the reference genome with Bismark
. Deduplication step to remove alignments with identical mapping position to avoid technical duplication in the results
. Methylation Extraction operates on Bismark alignment files and extracts the methylation call for every single C analyzed. --gzip is used to compress the output files in .gz format.
. Generate report and summary - The command bismark2report will generate a graphical HTML report for each sample (including the M-bias plot), using the reports generated from the previous steps (alignment, de-duplication, methylation extraction)
.
